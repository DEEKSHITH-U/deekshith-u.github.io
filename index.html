      <hr />
      <div class="about">
        <p>I am passionate about ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and secure systems. I enjoy solving CTFs, developing security tools, and analyzing network protocols. I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and DevOps practices.</p>
        <p>With a strong academic background and hands-on project work, I aim to bridge the gap between secure software development and scalable infrastructure. I actively participate in security challenges, contribute to open-source repos, and stay updated with modern attack vectors and defense strategies.</p>
